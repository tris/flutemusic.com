   <td width=660> If you enjoy the flute at all, here's your chance to hear a master at
work. Local Santa Cruz musician Kathleen Purcell only plays these solo
concerts two or three times a year so it's really not to be missed. With
precision fingerplay and rich, sparkling tone, Purcell's music magically
transforms the church into an extension of her flute. It's as though one
is inside the music, pulsing and floating to the highest arches, and then
swooping through on heavenly wing.
<p>
The concert March 20 offers an entr&eacute;e of ethnic/folk classical pieces from
various corners of the world, including the all-time beloved pieces of
Albinoni's Adagio and Gade's Tango Fantasia. This tango is better known
under the name of Jealousy and is a Hollywood movie favorite. Other pieces
will take the musical traveler to Japan twice, once by the Englishman
Scott with Lotus Land and another time with American 20th Century master
Hovahness.  Purcell will perform on alto flute for Hungarian Bartok's
Three Folksongs from the County of Csik and then she'll shrink down to
piccolo for Le Rossignol de l'Opera, a piece by Damare from the early
1900's, a time known as the Golden Age of the Piccolo. She'll play a
stopover in Spain with two pieces originally written for guitar,
Hasselman's Guitare, and the very difficult Rodrigo Fantasia para un
Gentilhombre. Ireland is on the itinerary as well, with Brian Boru's
March, a song made famous by flutist James Galway. Finally, she will
perform Larson's mesmerizing pieces Be Still My Soul and Slow Tears for
alto flute, piano, and synthesizer.
<p>
Santa Cruz is lucky to be able to have Purcell in its harbor of fine
artists. Since landing here several years ago she has teamed up with
Russian pianist and organist Vlada Volkova-Moran, who will be accompanying
at the concert.  Volkova-Moran came to Santa Cruz in 1998 and in addition
to her work with Purcell is in demand as an accompanist for numerous
groups including the Cabrillo Children and
Youth Choir, the Cabrillo Symphonic Chorus, and Ensemble Monterey. She
performs solo concerts in the San Francisco Bay Area and locally, and is
Organist with the First Congregational Church in Santa Cruz.
<p>
Purcell also performs in Duo Espressivo with UCSC faculty guitarist Mesut
Özgen.  She was a popular attraction at First Night Santa Cruz this past
New Year's Eve and she is scheduled to perform with Phil Collins' New
Music Works next month. She runs a busy and vibrant flute studio, teaching
emerging flutists as young as 7 years old to adult aficionados boasting
more than 50 years. She is known for her ability to make a student feel
good about themselves within a realistic appraisal of their musical
development.
<p>
Prior to coming to Santa Cruz, Purcell played principal flute under the
batons of Leopold Stokowski's associate Maurice Dubonnet, Robert Shaw, and
Richard Woitach of Metropolitan Opera fame. She studied with Richard Hahn
at the University of Idaho and Robert Cole at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison, where she received her Master of Music in Flute
Performance.
<p>
Highlights of her early career include touring Europe as Principal Flutist
with the United States Honor Band, running a flute studio at age 12, and
playing principal flute at age 17 for both the Anchorage Symphony
Orchestra and the Alaska Festival Orchestra.
