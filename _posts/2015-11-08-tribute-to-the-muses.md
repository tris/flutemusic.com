Santa Cruz Chamber Players. The Greek Muses were personifications of the spirits that move the creative process. This program, all music of the 20th century, will be a blending of music with the other performing arts. Not a journey into the land of myth, but rather a contemporary exploration of human creativity; a concert of music as it interacts with the other performing arts.
