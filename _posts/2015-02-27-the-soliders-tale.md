Members of Cabrillo's music department along with other local guest musicians and dancers present Stravinsky's dark Faustian fable about a deserting soldier and the Devil who eventually possesses his soul. The story is based on an old Russian folk tale but the music is as far removed from Russian traditionalism as possible, making it a lesson for all cultures and times. Proceeds for this concert will go entirely to scholarships for Cabrillo College music students.

Guest musicians Kathleen Purcell, flute, and Ivan Rosenblum, piano, will offer a sneak preview of their March 28th and 29th Santa Cruz Chamber Players concert as they play three movements from Erwin Schulhoff's Sonata for flute and piano. Ivan Rosenblum on Schulhoff:

>_The Flute Sonata, written in 1927 in Prague at the height of Schulhoffâ€™s career as a jazz pianist and composer, is filled with emphatic pulsating jazz rhythms that characterize much of his output. One can hear the influence of Paul Hindemith, who, like Schulhoff, was fond of writing for woodwinds. Both spent the early 1920s exploring the radical "new music" scene in Germany. In the Flute Sonata, we also hear musical influences from Bartok, Stravinsky and Debussy._
