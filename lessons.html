<p>
Each private lesson is tailored to fit the unique needs and support the
spirit of the individual student.  There are no judgments.  Mistakes are
welcomed as exciting gifts that allow the student to learn more about
himself and his process.  Being on this path of self-discovery, the student
learns to trust his process, experience continuous success, and become so
tuned-in to himself that he recognizes that he is indeed his own teacher.

The Santa Cruz Sentinel quotes Purcell from an August 2001 interview: <i><b>"It's about relaxing and never thinking that you're supposed to be some other place than you are right now."</b></i><br>
from "WHAT THEY SAID - Words of wisdom from a year of arts and performance."<br>

<p><i><b>About her teaching:</b></i></p>

<p>"Ms. Purcell's approach to the musical aspects of performance is well
intermeshed with her analytical abilities in the technical aspects of flute
playing.  Most important is her consistent ability to enable her students
to feel really good about themselves within a realistic appraisal of their
musical development.  The success of this approach has been demonstrated by
these same students' continued interest and enthusiasm in their musical
experiences."</p>

- Professor Emeritus Richard Hahn<br>
Former Milwaukee Symphony Flutist<br>
Past President, National Flute Association<br>
<br>

<p>"Through Kathleen's instruction, I have become a polished flutist. She has
prepared me for many musical endeavors and auditions that have built my
confidence as a musician. She is not only an exceptional flutist but she
has become a dear friend as well. She truly cares about her students and
wants them to succeed."</p>

- Jamie Malone<br>
Purcell Flute Studios' student since 2002<br>
<br>

<p>"Kathleen has a passion and gift for teaching and gives great attention to
detail. She is not limited to a single style of teaching, but rather
tailors her approach to suit the learning style of the individual.
Realistic feedback is given to her students in a positive way; in this way
she is able to inspire students to work hard at music, and even more
importantly instill a strong love for it."</p>

- Owen Meehan<br>
Purcell Flute Studios' student since 2005<br>
<br>

<p>"As a senior citizen I decided to play the flute and found my way to
Kathleen.  She made the initial challenge fun and interesting, and
continues to help me advance my playing and achieve new goals.  With her
patient guidance I've participated in recitals and performed in the
community.  She is an excellent teacher and performer, and has become a
valued friend."</p>
